Load student dropout dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Utilizing this dataset we will be classifying students into one of three
categories: graduate, dropout, or enrolled. The dataset includes features 
about students such as their age, financial status, and past
school performance. 

The dataset can be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository here: 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success
