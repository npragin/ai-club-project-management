    "Author: Kellen Sullivan\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an introductory tutorial for the deep learning library PyTorch. PyTorch gives professional developers the tools to create and train their own custom neural networks, and is the most commonly used deep learning framework in research and academia.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will be taught the fundamentals of PyTorch, through building your own neural network to classify hand-written digits. For this task, you will use the MNIST dataset, which is a collection of thousands of hand written digits with corresponding lables. Below is a sample of 4 hand-written digits from the dataset and their corresponding labels.\n",

    "While you work through this tutorial and its exercises, its highly encouraged to check out the provided lecture videos created by math youtuber 3Blue1Brown. He explains the math behind the deep learning concepts this tutorial will breifly introduce, and his tutorials reference the exact same neural network that you will be building! His lessons are available to watch or read for free with the following link: [3Blue1Brown Neural Networks Lectures](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/neural-networks)\n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started using PyTorch, you first have to install it! To do so, open a new terminal and run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are on Windows/Mac: `pip3 install torch torchvision`\n",
    "- If you are on Linux: `pip3 install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these commands will use your CPU as the compute platform. If you have an NVIDIA GPU, you can install PyTorch with CUDA as the compute platform to greatly speed up training. Check out the official installation guide to learn more: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/"
