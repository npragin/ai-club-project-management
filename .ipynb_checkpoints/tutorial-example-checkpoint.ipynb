    "This is an example tutorial for the AI Club Project Management team.\n",

    "1. Introduce the concept\n",
    "2. Show examples via code and explain how it works\n",
    "3. Present a practical exercise for the user to solve with test cases to verify their solution\n",
    "4. Present an example solution to the exercise\n",
    "5. Repeat the process for each concept\n",
    "\n",
    "Some general advice:\n",
    "- Use markdown cells to explain the concepts, they are much more readable than comments in the code cells\n",
    "- Don't be afraid to search the internet for existing tutorials, but make sure to cite your sources!\n",
    "  - This can be especially helpful for explaining what happens behind the scenes of a function call or understanding the best order to present the material\n",

    "**Congratulations! You've mastered NumPy array addition!** Here's what we covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Element-wise Addition**\n",
    "- Arrays must have **identical shapes**\n",
    "- Each element adds to its corresponding element\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Broadcasting** \n",
    "- Allows adding arrays of **different but compatible shapes**\n",
    "- Scalar broadcasting is the most common case\n",
    "- Follow broadcasting rules to predict behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Syntax Options**\n",
    "- Use `+` operator (most common and readable)\n",
    "- Use `np.add()` for functional programming styles\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Types**\n",
    "- NumPy handles type promotion automatically\n",
    "- Result promoted to prevent data loss (int + float â†’ float)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Error Prevention**\n",
    "- Always check array shapes when debugging: `array.shape`\n",
    "- Incompatible shapes will raise `ValueError`\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Next Steps**\n",
    "Try these operations with your own arrays! Experiment with different shapes and data types to build intuition.\n"
