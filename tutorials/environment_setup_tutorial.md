# Environment Setup Tutorial

Author: Noah Pragin

This tutorial will guide you through setting up your development environment and preparing it for project work! In this tutorial, we will:

- Get you on the engineering servers (optional)
- Set up GitHub and git
- Download and set up VS Code, the application you'll use to write code (optional)
- Ready Python and Python's package manager Pip
- Introduce Python virtual environments

## Where Will You Work?
You have two options for where you will write your code and train your models. The first is your computer, and the second is the engineering servers that OSU makes available to its students. OSU's engineering servers offer a Linux environment with numerous pre-installed tools, where CS and ECE students complete the majority of their coursework. We recommend using the ENGR servers, but you are free to make your own decision. To help you, here are the pros and cons of each environment:

| | Pros | Cons |
| - | - | - |
| **Engineering Servers** | - No need to install Python or Pip, it's ready for you<br>- If you end up needing to use the HPC it will be *slightly* easier to move your files over<br>- Keep your computer clean, you will already be doing a lot of work on the engineering servers as a CS/ECE student<br>- Consistent environment across groups (Linux), no "works on my machine" issues<br>- Don't take up space on your own computer | - You will need internet access to work on your project<br>- Can be slower on occasion due to network latency|
| **Your Computer** | - No internet access required to work on your project<br>- More responsive development experience (no latency because no internet connection)<br>- Full control over your environment | - Need to install Python and Pip yourself<br>- Potential issues for collaboration if partners use a different OS than you<br>- Uses up your storage space (datasets are big)<br>- Harder for us to help you |

#### **If you choose to work locally (on your own computer), skip to the [GitHub and git Setup section](#git), otherwise continue to the Getting on the ENGR Servers section**

### Getting on the ENGR Servers
1. Navigate to [teach.engr.oregonstate.edu](https://teach.engr.oregonstate.edu/teach.php?type=want_auth)
2. Log in to TEACH using the same credentials you would use to access your email
3. If it fails, you do not have a TEACH account and need to create one by clicking "Create a new account (Enable your Engineering resources)"
4. Open a terminal and run `ssh <ONID>@access.engr.oregonstate.edu`, **replacing &lt;ONID&gt; with your ONID username** (for example, mine is praginn)
5. Enter your ONID password if prompted
6. Select your DUO device when prompted, and complete the MFA
7. You should now be able to execute commands on the ENGR servers!

### ENGR Access Verification

To ensure you are on the ENGR servers, run the command `hostname` and verify that you see something like `flipX.engr.oregonstate.edu`, where X is a number 1-4.

## <a id="git"></a>GitHub and git Setup

Now that you know where you'll be working, we will get you set up with git and GitHub. Git is a version control system that helps you track changes to your code, and GitHub is a platform that hosts git repositories (AKA projects) online. Together, they allow you to save your work, collaborate with others, and maintain a history of your project changes to show others.

#### **If you already have git and GitHub set up wherever you decided to work (verifiable via the [verification step for this section](#git-verification)), skip to the [Visual Studio Code Setup section](#vsc)**

#### **If you already have a GitHub account, skip to the [Setting up SSH Keys for GitHub section](#git-ssh)**

### Creating a GitHub Account
If you don't have a GitHub account, click this [link](https://github.com/signup) to create one

**NOTE**: Use your personal email for this! Your GitHub account should be a portfolio of your work, meaning it should persist after you graduate and your school email is deactivated.

### <a id="git-ssh"></a> Setting up SSH Keys for GitHub
SSH keys provide a secure way to authenticate with GitHub without entering your password every time. We'll generate these keys on the ENGR servers (or your local machine if working locally).

1. In your terminal, run `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@email.com"`, **replacing `your_email@email.com` with the email address associated with your GitHub account**
2. When prompted for where to store the keys, press Enter to use the default location
3. When prompted for a passphrase, you can leave it empty (just press Enter) for convenience, but adding a passphrase is more secure
4. Your key has now been created. Next we must print the public key by running `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
5. Copy the SSH key by selecting and copying the entire output (usually Ctrl+Shift+C or Cmd+Shift+C)
6. Add the key to GitHub:
    1. Go to GitHub and click your profile icon (top-right corner)
    2. Go to Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
    3. Give your key a descriptive title (like "OSU ENGR Servers" or "My Laptop")
    4. Paste your copied key into the "Key" field
    5. Click "Add SSH Key"

### <a id="git-verification"></a>GitHub SSH Keys Verification

To ensure your SSH keys were set up correctly, run `ssh -T git@github.com` in your terminal. You should see a message like:

```txt
Hi <username>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

### Creating Your First Repository

Now that your SSH keys are set up, let's create a test repository to practice the complete git workflow. This will help you understand how to create projects, make changes, and sync them between your local environment and GitHub.

#### **If you've made a repository before and hosted it on GitHub, skip to the [Visual Studio Code Setup section](#vsc)**

1. **Create a repository on GitHub:**
   1. On GitHub, click the "+" icon in the top-right corner, then select "New repository"
   2. Give your repository a name like `test-repo` or `my-first-project`
   3. Check the box "Add a README file" (this adds a README.md file to your project, used to describe the repository so others know what it's about)
      - Normally, I would advise against initializing a repository with a README, but for this tutorial, it simplifies the process
   4. Click "Create repository"

2. **Clone the repository to your working environment:**
   1. On your new repository's main page, click the green "Code" button
   2. Make sure "SSH" is selected (not HTTPS)
   3. Copy the SSH URL (it should look like `git@github.com:yourusername/test-repo.git`)
   4. In your terminal, navigate to where you want to store your projects
   5. Clone the repository: `git clone <paste-your-SSH-URL-here>`
   6. Navigate into the new directory: `cd test-repo` (or whatever you named it)

4. **Make some changes and push them back to GitHub:**
   1. Make a change to the README file: `echo "\nThis is my first GitHub repository!" >> README.md`
   2. Check what files have changed: `git status`
   3. Stage your changes: `git add README.md` (or `git add .` to add all changes)
   4. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Updated README with a personal message"`
   5. Push to GitHub: `git push`

### Git and GitHub Workflow Verification

If you can see your updated README.md file in your repository on GitHub with your changes, congratulations! You've successfully completed the full git/GitHub workflow. You now know how to:
- Create repositories on GitHub
- Clone them to your local environment
- Make changes and push them back
- Sync your work between local and remote copies of your repository

This workflow is exactly what you'll use for your AI Club project throughout the term.

## <a id="vsc"></a> Visual Studio Code Setup
How to download VSC, what extensions to download (Python, Jupyter, remote SSH, PyLance if it doesn't come with Python)
## Python and Pip download
Should use ENGR to just module load, but link to the Python download documentation
## venv setup and usage
Set up a venv, source it, Pip install something with venv sourced, deactivate, and show that the dependency is only available after sourcing the venv

TODO(npragin): Make sure there are verification steps throughout for students to ensure they've done things correctly
