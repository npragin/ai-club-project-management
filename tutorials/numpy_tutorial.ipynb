A single example might be a list of features (measurements used to make predictions), a picture (a grid of pixels), or a short sequence over time, and we usually process **many** examples at once, in what we call \"batches\". A multi-dimensional array lets us keep each \"dimension\" of the data separate (rows, columns, time, color channels, batch size) and run fast operations without Python loops\n",
