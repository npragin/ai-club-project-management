    "This is an example tutorial for the AI Club Project Management team.\n",

    "1. Introduce the concept\n",
    "2. Show examples via code and explain how it works\n",
    "3. Present a practical exercise for the user to solve with test cases to verify their solution\n",
    "4. Present an example solution to the exercise\n",
    "5. Repeat the process for each concept\n",
    "\n",
    "Some general advice:\n",
    "- Use markdown cells to explain the concepts, they are much more readable than comments in the code cells\n",
    "- Don't be afraid to search the internet for existing tutorials, but make sure to cite your sources!\n",
    "  - This can be especially helpful for explaining what happens behind the scenes of a function call or understanding the best order to present the material\n",

    "- Use `+` operator (most common and readable)\n",
    "- Use `np.add()` for functional programming styles\n",
