    "## Get to know SK-learn\n",
    "### What is Scikit-learn?\n",
    "Scikit-learn (AKA sk-learn) is written in Python, an open source project, and is **one of the most used ML libraries today**. Sklearn contains modules built on top of Numpy, SciPy, and Matplotlib libraries containing tons of algorithms--ready to use to train, evaluate, and save models straight out of the box!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why learn Scikit-learn?\n",
    "With sk-learn, we don’t need an in-depth understanding of complex concepts like linear algebra or calculus. By using sk-learn’s pretrained neural networks and ML algorithms, we can easily preprocess datasets for supervised learning (regression or classification) and unsupervised learning (clustering and dimensionality reduction) applications."

    "## Datasets\n",
    "When doing machine learning, we need data to train and evaluate our models, because without data, we can't learn patterns, validate performance, or generalize to unseen examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn provides tools to do that via built-in datasets, dataset loading utilities, and data preprocessing functions (like [train_test_split](https://sklearn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features and Labels\n",
    "In machine learning, we use data to train models to make predictions or decisions. This data is typically structured into two main parts:\n",
    "1. **Features (Input)**\n",
    "- Features are the input variables (also called independent variables) that the model uses to learn.\n",
    "- Think of them as the measurable properties or characteristics of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example:** In a house price prediction dataset, features might include the number of bedrooms, square footage, and location.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Labels (Output)**\n",
    "- The label is the target variable (also called the dependent variable) — it’s what you want the model to predict.\n",
    "- Think of it as: The correct answer for each example in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example:** For house prices, the label is the actual price of the house."

    "Raw data is rarely in a form that machine learning models can use effectively. Without data preparation, we risk: Poor performance, Errors or crashes, and Bias or misleading results.\n",
    "\n",

    "To efficiently train and evaluate model performance, the dataset will be split into the training set and testing set.\n",

    "80% training and 20% testing data is the most common split for larger datasets. \n",
    "Iris is a small dataset containing only 150 samples, so we’ll use 60% for training and 40% for testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, set parameter `test_size=0.4`. By adding setting `random_state=1`, we can ensure the split is consistent with each run for reproducibility.\n",
