    "## Get to know SK-learn\n",
    "### What is Scikit-learn?\n",
    "Scikit-learn (AKA sk-learn) is written in Python, an open source project, and is **one of the most used ML libraries today**. Sk-learn is built on top of Numpy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, and contains tons of algorithms ready to use to train, evaluate, and save models straight out of the box!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why learn Scikit-learn?\n",
    "With sk-learn, we don’t need to implement complex algorithms built on a backbone of linear algebra and statistics. By using sk-learn’s ML algorithms and neural networks, we can build models faster while getting familiar with industry-standard tools."

    "## Datasets\n",
    "When doing machine learning, we need data to train and evaluate our models, because without data, we can't learn patterns, validate performance, or generalize to unseen examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn provides tools to do that via built-in datasets, dataset loading utilities, and data preprocessing functions (like [train_test_split](https://sklearn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features and Labels\n",
    "In machine learning, we use data to train models to make predictions or decisions. This data is typically structured into two main parts:\n",
    "1. **Features (Input)**\n",
    "- Features are the input variables (also called independent variables) that the model uses to learn.\n",
    "- Think of them as the measurable properties or characteristics representing what causes or correlates to your output\n",
    "- Features are real numbers or are non-numeric and have been transformed into a numerical representation\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example:** In a house price prediction dataset, features might include the number of bedrooms, square footage, and location.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Labels (Output)**\n",
    "- The label is the target variable (also called the dependent variable). Labels are what you want the model to predict.\n",
    "- Think of it as the correct answer for each example in the dataset.\n",

    "##### Deciding on a split\n",
    "80% training and 20% testing data is the most common split for larger datasets. \n",
    "Since most of sk-learn's toy datasets are small, we’ll use 60% for training and 40% for testing to ensure we can be confident about our evaluation results. \n",
    "\n",
